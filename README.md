Neuralizer
==========

Neuralizer, is a tool to find substitute neural network model for complicated kinetic models. Kinetics models are always consists of complex mathematical equations, which make real-time control difficult. In contrast, neural network models are less time-consuming and computionally costing, while giving accurate predictions.

The module is built on top of Keras
